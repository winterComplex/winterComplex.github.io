To attend the winter school, we ask all interested individuals to submit an application form and a CV. Bear in mind the following dates:

The application form is available [here](https://forms.gle/x5U1eX4tpsoRYzHS7).

We aim to create an inclusive, diverse, sociable, and motivated group of young researchers. Excellent applicants with no previous experiences with complexity research will also be considered. In the last years 20-30% of applicants were invited to attend the winter school.

## Registration

The workshop registration fee is 250EUR and it includes:
- Accommodation from Sunday to Friday (5 nights)
- Breakfast at accommodation
- Lunch and coffee breaks at the workshop location
- Social Dinner on Thursday

The workshop will exclusively be an onsite event. In case of restrictions due to pandemics, we will cancel the event.

## Accommodation

We will provide you with shared rooms of 4-people at [Generator Hostel](https://staygenerator.com/hostels/amsterdam) in Oosterpark. We will split the rooms based on sex. If you prefer a different arrangement, please send us an email to [wwcs2023amsterdam@gmail.com](mailto:wwcs2023amsterdam@gmail.com). In case you prefer to have a single room, we ask you to arrange it yourself at [Generator Hostel](https://staygenerator.com/hostels/amsterdam).


## Travel Grant

We hope to enable all students independent of financial means to attend the winter school. Therefore, we have reserved a limited budget for travel grants. Please send us an email with a motivation (200 words) and a list of needed funds to our email address [wwcs2023amsterdam@gmail.com](mailto:wwcs2023amsterdam@gmail.com). With the acceptance letter, we will notify you with how much money we can support you. In case the required budget exceeds the available funds, we might not be able to cover all your needed costs.
